# ToDo-App-in-JavaScript

freeCodeCamp Practice Project.

JavaScript DataStructures and Algorithms.


Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. This allows web apps to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session.

In this TODO application, I learnt how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.
